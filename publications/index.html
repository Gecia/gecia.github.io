    <p> 
      Data anonymization is an approach to privacy-preserving data release aimed at preventing participants reidentification, 
      and it is an important alternative to differential privacy in applications that cannot tolerate noisy data. 
      Existing algorithms for enforcing k-anonymity in the released data assume that the curator performing the anonymization has complete access to the original data. 
      Reasons for limiting this access range from undesirability to complete infeasibility. 
      This paper explores ideas -- objectives, metrics, protocols, and extensions -- for reducing the trust that must be placed in the curator, 
      while still maintaining a statistical notion of k-anonymity. 
      We suggest trust (amount of information provided to the curator) and privacy (anonymity of the participants) as the primary objectives of such a framework. 
      We describe a class of protocols aimed at achieving these goals, proposing new metrics of privacy in the process, and proving related bounds. 
      We conclude by discussing a natural extension of this work that completely removes the need for a central curator.

    <p>How might one test the hypothesis that graphs were sampled from the same distribution? 
      Here, we compare two statistical tests that address this question. 
      The first uses the observed subgraph densities themselves as estimates of those of the underlying distribution. 
      The second test uses a new approach that converts these subgraph densities into estimates of the graph cumulants of the distribution. 
      We demonstrate -- via theory, simulation, and application to real data -- the superior statistical power of using graph cumulants.</p>

    <p>Over a century ago, Thiele (1889) introduced cumulants, a concept now fundamental to the field of statistics, which has justifiably percolated throughout the scientific community. In this work, we introduce graph cumulants, their generalization to networks. This principled hierarchy of network statistics provides a framework to systematically describe and compare networks, naturally including those with additional features, such as directed edges, node attributes, and edge weights. Moreover, through the lens of the maximum entropy principle, these statistics induce a natural hierarchical family of network models. These models are immune to the "degeneracy problem", providing a principled prescription for obtaining distributions that are clustered around the properties of the network they intend to model.</p>

    <p>Some new tasks are trivial to learn, while others are essentially impossible; what determines
how easy it is to learn the structure of a given task? Similar to how our priors about visual
scenes demonstrably color our perception of the world, our priors about the structure of
tasks shape our learning, decision-making, and generalization abilities. Drawing inspiration
from the insights afforded to neuroscience by the characterization of visual priors, in this
dissertation, we strive to quantify priors over abstract structures. In particular, we focus on
graphs: the structure of interactions.

<br />
In Chapter 3, we describe the natural analogue of cumulants (e.g., mean, (co)variance,
skew, kurtosis) for graphs, building a hierarchical description based on local correlations
between an increasing number of connections. This provides a principled framework for
quantifying the propensity of a network to display arbitrary substructures, and allows one to
meaningfully compare networks of different sizes and edge densities.

<br />
In Chapter 4, we analyze graph structure globally, via the dynamics of diffusion,
providing an algorithm that reduces a graph while preserving its large-scale structure.
Our framework analytically unifies two areas of research, namely graph sparsification
(removing edges) and graph coarsening (merging nodes), and is competitive with current
state-of-the-art algorithms.

<br />
From a neuroscience perspective, we develop a novel method for quantifying human
priors over graphs (Chapters 2 and 3). In Chapter 5, we apply this method to graphical
representations of social and navigation tasks: two domains that have been relevant (over
evolutionary timescales) to our everyday life. We find that the resulting priors exhibit
non-trivial graphical structure. While some features appear to be general, such as the
preferred amount of sparsity as a function of graph size, other features appear to be
domain-specific, such as the preference for triadic closure in social interactions.

    <p>We constructed a gender-labeled temporal bipartite graph of academic collaborations in the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) spanning over six decades. Employing two metrics based on the graph Laplacian which are sensitive to global connectivity, we analyze the relevance of gender in these collaboration patterns.</p>
